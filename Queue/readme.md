A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. In a queue, elements are added to the back (rear) and removed from the front (front). It's similar to standing in a queue in real life â€“ the first person who joins the queue is the first to be served.

Here is the basic structure of a queue:

- Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
- Front: Retrieves the element at the front of the queue.
- IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
- Size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.


Here's a basic pseudocode for a queue implementation:

```
Class Queue
    Data:
        items: list

    Method: enqueue(item)
        Add item to the end of the items list

    Method: dequeue()
        If the queue is not empty
            Remove and return the item from the front of the items list
        Else
            Raise an exception or return an error indicating underflow

    Method: front()
        If the queue is not empty
            Return the item from the front of the items list
        Else
            Return null or raise an exception indicating underflow

    Method: is_empty()
        Return True if the items list is empty, else False

    Method: size()
        Return the number of elements in the items list
```

Now, let's write a simple Python implementation of a queue:

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)
        else:
            raise IndexError("Cannot dequeue from an empty queue")

    def front(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[0]
        else:
            return None  # or raise an exception

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

# Example usage:
my_queue = Queue()
my_queue.enqueue(1)
my_queue.enqueue(2)
my_queue.enqueue(3)

print("Front of the queue:", my_queue.front())  # Output: 1

print("Dequeue:", my_queue.dequeue())  # Output: 1

print("Is the queue empty?", my_queue.is_empty())  # Output: False

print("Size of the queue:", my_queue.size())  # Output: 2
```


This is a basic implementation of a queue in Python using a list to store elements. Note that using `pop(0)` to dequeue is not very efficient for large queues, as it requires shifting all elements. For a more efficient implementation, you might consider using collections.deque, which allows for O(1) time complexity for both enqueue and dequeue operations.
