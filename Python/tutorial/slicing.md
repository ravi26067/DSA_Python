Slicing in Python refers to extracting a specific portion of a sequence like strings, lists, tuples, etc., by specifying start, stop, and step indices within square brackets `[]`. It allows you to create a new sequence containing elements from the original sequence based on the specified indices.

The syntax for slicing is `[start:stop:step]`, where:
- `start` is the starting index of the slice (inclusive). If omitted, slicing starts from the beginning (index 0).
- `stop` is the stopping index of the slice (exclusive). If omitted, slicing goes till the end of the sequence.
- `step` is the step size or increment for the slice. If omitted, it defaults to 1.

Here are some examples illustrating slicing:

### String Slicing:

```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Extracting characters from index 1 to index 5 (exclusive)
substring = my_string[1:5]
print(substring)  # Output: 'ello'

# Slicing with a step of 2
every_second = my_string[::2]
print(every_second)  # Output: 'Hlo ol!'

# Reversing a string using slicing
reversed_string = my_string[::-1]
print(reversed_string)  # Output: '!dlroW ,olleH'
```

### List Slicing:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Extracting elements from index 2 to index 6 (exclusive)
sublist = my_list[2:6]
print(sublist)  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6]

# Slicing with a step of 3
every_third = my_list[::3]
print(every_third)  # Output: [1, 4, 7]

# Reversing a list using slicing
reversed_list = my_list[::-1]
print(reversed_list)  # Output: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

Slicing allows you to extract parts of sequences efficiently without modifying the original sequence. It's a powerful feature in Python, enabling various manipulations like extracting substrings, selecting specific elements, reversing sequences, and more.
